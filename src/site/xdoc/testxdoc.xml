				This application demonstrates Maven 2 site generation functionalities.
				One of the nicer features of Maven is the ability to create an
				internal technical web site
				at very little cost. Maven 2 extends this functionality, and gives you
				powerful new ways
				to generate site content...

			<subsection name="Team Communication">


				Team communication is an essential part of any project. And wasting
				time looking for technical project information can be costly and
				frustrating. Clearly,
				any IT project will benefit from having its own dedicated technical web
				site. Some
				useful things it provides are:
				<ul>
					<li>Online javadoc</li>
					<li>Quality assurance</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Static code audits with Checkstyle or PMD </li>
				</ul>
